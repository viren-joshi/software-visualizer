# Software Dependency Visualizer

Software Dependency Visualizer is a tool aimed at identifying the class level dependency information of JARs with the help of inheritance, implementation and composition. It provides this in an easily visualized manner via flash and graphical based navigations allowing users to visualize the structure of their software projects. Further, the tool can help in project management by enabling its users to store their dependency analyses and then load them for further evaluation and modification.

### Dependencies
- Java 17
- Maven 
- Node.js 


## CI/CD

The project is integrated with CI-CD pipeline for automated builds, testing and deployment. The workflow files are in `.github/worklows` directory of the repository.

### Testing & Code Coverage

We utilize `JUnit`, a widely used open-source testing framework for Java, to ensure the quality of our application. JUnit tests are integrated into our CI pipeline by executing the mvn test command, which leverages the Maven build tool to run the tests. 

We also ensure that all components of the system are tested via `JaCoCo`; it tells us the code coverage. 
The code coverage report generated by Jacoco is also stored in the server which can be accessed reotely.

### Code Quality

The Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline of the application includes a stage for code quality assurance. 

The backend code quality is assessed using [DesigniteJava](https://www.designite-tools.com/products-dj), a code smell detection tool that generates reports highlighting potential issues in the code. These reports are stored on the server and can be downloaded later for detailed analysis.

### TDD adherence
We followed the Test Driven Development (TDD) for building the project.

### Design Principles

We adhered to design principles in the design and development phases of creating this project.

<h4>Single Responsibility Principle</h4>

<p>The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one responsibility, encouraging the separation of concerns and making the code easier to modify, test, and reuse. We followed this principle by creating dedicated controllers and services for different stakeholders, ensuring clear and focused functionality.

This principle was implemented in our project via modularization of functioanlities into different packages and classes, namely, `util`, `service`, `model`, `controller` and `configs`.
